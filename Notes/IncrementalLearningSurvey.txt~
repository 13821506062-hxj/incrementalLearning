Complexity using param metric:
LVQ:k*#Prototypes*#Dimension+1* + #Dimension^2
RF:(Nodes-Leaves) * 3 + Leaves
SVM:#SV*(#Dimensions+1) + 1
iELM:#Dimension*#HiddenNeurons+#HiddenNeurons*#numClasses
LPPNSE:RF +  numChunks
LPP:RF + numChunks
GNB: numFeatures*nclases+nFeatures*nClasses

LVGB: (Nodes-Leaves) * 3 + Leaves

Nonstationary drift taxonomy:
something with virtual drift, imbalanced und region aendern

sea              abrupt real drift, p(y|x) is changed
rbfSlow          incremental real drift, p(x) and p(y|x) is changed
hyperplaneSlow   incremental real drift, p(y|x) is changed
souza2CHT        incremental real drift, reoccuring, p(x) and p(y|x) is changed
souzaGears2C2D   incremental real drift, reoccuring, p(x) and p(y|x) is changed
souza4CREV1      incremental real drift, reoccuring, p(x) and p(y|x) is changed










kick rbfFast          incremental real drift, p(x) and p(y|x) is changed
kick hyperplaneFast   incremental real drift, p(y|x) is changed
kick souza2CDT        incremental real drift, reoccuring, p(x) and p(y|x) is changed
kick souzaFG2C2D      incremental real drift, p(x) and p(y|x) is changed


ToDo:
-read papers from slides of jacomo and ditzler
-Distanz zwisschen verteilungen im Verlauf sch√§tzen, kullback leibler divergenz, parzen window, alex fragen
-NB in leaves leads to parameter explosion for high number of features using GNB for example.

-find out where all matlab alg get stuck for news20, probably predict, or train?
-Hyperparams unscaled news20, all nonstationary

scaled to do
souza2ht
rbfSlow
CBConst
CBSin

unscaled nonstationary tuned :
sea,
souzaGears,
souza2CHT
souza4CREV1
weather,
rbfslow,
covtype,
keystroke,




-What were the params rbfSlow & rbfFast were generated?
Slow: speedChange 0.001, 10 dimensions, 10000 samples, 10 classes, 50 centroids, 50 drift centroids
Fast: speedChange 0.01, 10 dimensions, 10000 samples, 10 classes, 50 centroids, 50 drift centroids

Slow: speedChange 0.001, 10 dimensions, 50000 samples, 5 classes, 50 centroids, 50 drift centroids
Fast: speedChange 0.01, 10 dimensions, 50000 samples, 5 classes, 50 centroids, 50 drift centroids

Hyperplane:
Slow: speedChange 0.001, 10 dimensions, 50000 samples, 5 classes, 10 drift features
Fast: speedChange 0.01, 10 dimensions, 50000 samples, 5 classes, 10 drift features

-Find Journal
-Write
-Title?
-what about training course as well as convergence speed?
-Publish Algorithm for incremental LVQ
-Publish rbfFast, rbfSlow, add missing datasets links, add link moa


Discuss chunksize absolut/relative problem with Barbara & Heiko,
as well as size for scaling,
as well as size for hyperparam tuning
